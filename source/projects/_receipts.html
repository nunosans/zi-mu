    At beginning of the time in London, I collected all the receipts to manage
    my expenses of shopping. I found many different patterns, typography and
    fonts on receipts, which were attracting me. I designed a Zine about my
    receipts-my life in London.

    In the Zine, there is a poster only with scanned time point from receipts,
    which is my shopping diary. The booklet is binding by receipts I chosen
    from my collection, having beautiful pattern. I created a recipe using the
    typography and fonts from receipt.
